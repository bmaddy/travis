    Wish I had access to a report with one row for each failure that has not been hand-marked as evaluated and the following columns: Time/date, Partner code, E-mail address, E-mail domain, Errors, 'Evaluated' button. 'Evaluated.  Delete this profile' button. I wish we stored a permanent record of each failure and each action.  (The only actions for now are 'Evaluated / Do nothing' and 'Evaluated / Delete this Profile'
    Easier manual failure handling.
    Building block for automated failure handling.

  title: Associate a primary internal admin for an account
  lock_version: "9"
  id: "50"
  mnemonic: ACOU-50
  description: |
    An internal admin can associate one other internal admin with an account. The user profile associated with the account is typically a GovDelivery Client Services employee, such as an Account Manager. 
    
    This is the person who has management responsibility for the account. 
    
    In the future we will want this user to receive messages related to the account. Also, we'll want to be able to filter accounts by which internal admin is responsible for the account. 
    
    Rules
    The Internal Admin exists in the system
    Select the admin from a drop list
    If the admin is deleted, set the value to 'unassigned'
    One admin owner per account
    
    Use Case:
    Internal admin logs into EVO
    Internal admin enters new account account info
    Internal admin now enters Account Manager info affiliated with the account
    User hits save
    User goes back to home page

    This is crucial to follow to know what features the account has when being set up by internal admins
    This determines the accounts  functionality 
    Super Users and Account Managers are granted access to all
    Account admins have the most privileges over there own account and can also create others = or > 
    All other options that users don't have access to should be grayed out and not editable on the page
    
    
    This also applies to options being set when account is first created. only account managers and super users have access to change account options

    Subscribers should have the ability to delete their profile and all of their subscriptions as one task. For example, I have 5 profiles for 5 accounts, all with the same email address should be deleted from all accounts at once. We need to verify this reqt with the Account Managers before we implement it.

    **Question for Brett:**
    
    For the current implementation, gd.net is only ever seen as embedded pages or widgets, presumably on a partners website.  To implement this story we will need to put a public face on gd.net itself.  Is this within scope of the deliverable for this summer?
    
    **Response**
    This story is not on the list for this summer. It is my expectation that, for the near term, subscribers will edit their profiles on an account-by-account basis, similar to the way they handle it in the Network. Visit export.gov for an example of the network.
    Thanks, Brett

    In this story, the admin wants to be sure that subscribers who use text-only email clients will see well-formatted emails. At some point in the future, we'll even store  a \"send only text\" option with the subscriber. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    For this first story, allow the admin to see how the text will render in these text-only email clients. Many ESPs even allow the text version to be modified directly. In Legend, we just send multi-part MIME. We should convert the HTML to text by default, but give admins the ability to access the text version if they don't like how it looks during a preview step. "

    Need to be able to determine the monthly sending budget for the client so that GovDelivery can control message sending costs through a third party
    For example, CDC agrees to 20K sending units per month at a cost of $.10 per unit (i.e. .10 * 20K = $2K/Mo.), while St Louis Park, MN agrees to 500 sending units per month at a cost of $.15 per unit (i.e. .15 * 20K = $75/Mo.)

    The Admin list page allows filtering by role, account, AND email address. 
    
    AND is important because we can filter first by role, then by email address to find a user or group users.
    
    Filters can be at the account level (e.g. I already selected FBI, so now I can filter the FBI user profiles) or global (e.g. I'm an internal user and I can see ALL user profiles)
    
    The user lists should separate subscribers and admins.
    please allow for spaces before or after the keyword or subject the user will be filtering on.
    Charc or symbols are also allowed.

    When an internal admin logs into Evo, they can access to a list of accounts (see Evo ticket ACOUT-49, Itr 1), from this page they can navigate from account to account so they make changes at each of those accounts. 
    
    This story is tied directly to [ACOU-93](http://buildbox/travis/stories/93) although it isn't the same story.

    Use Case
    1. AccountAdmin logs into EVO
    2. AccountAdmin clicks Admins link from home page
    3. EVO displays Account list page with the logged in user at the top of the list. All other users are in alpha order below. 
    3. Admin clicks his own user profile from the list
    4. AccountAdmin edits last name
    5. AccountAdmin clicks Save
    6. Evo displays Account Home page, with updated info
    
    Extension

    **NOTES ON USAGE**  
    this story is satisfied by adding the ability to load seed data into a brand-new database.
    
    This can be done by executing the following:
    
    `RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed`
    
    **This will destroy the database for the environment that it's pointed at!!!**  If we get a requirement that we need to be able to replace/append/save existing data while still being able to run this, it will need to be reworked.

    DNS: Should this be classified under \"subscriptions\"?  There are trade-offs to the proposed approach at right.\r\n\
    I wish we did a better job (based upon Julie\xEF\xBF\xBDs list of common mistakes) of noticing when an e-mail address couldn\xEF\xBF\xBDt possibly be valid.  I wish we performed this check everywhere e-mail addresses can get added to the system.\r\n\
    When a subscriber submits the \xEF\xBF\xBDNew Subscriber\xEF\xBF\xBD form (presently login_new.html), I wish we attempted to send the \xEF\xBF\xBDWelcome New Subscriber\xEF\xBF\xBD e-mail for some easily-modifiable timeout period.  Only if we get a 500-series error back from the remote MTA, we should kick the subscriber back to the \xEF\xBF\xBDNew Subscriber\xEF\xBF\xBD page with an error.  If anything other than a 500-series error happens (including if the connection times out), then we should assume this address is innocent until proven guilty.\r\n\

    Want the system to Send welcome new user email for all new administrators
    user: admin
    
    The email contains an encrypted link to the system's password create page.
    
    (See Story [USER-107](http://buildbox/travis/stories/107))
    
    Link expires in 24 hours. For a new user profile, when the link is expired the admin user must be created from scratch. For the reset password scenario, the admin user must start the process over (e.g. access the login page, click reset PW, etc.)
    
    Use Case:
    1. User gets set up with account by an internal admin
    2. Internal admin enters all the info for the account along with verifying the clients account. the account admins email address associated with the client is entered
    3. Account Admin gets the welcome email in their inbox to set up password and make any updates to the their account profile.
    4. Same scenarios can happen for Category Admin, Topic, Report Viewer etc

    From Brett:
    1) Roles & Rights limit access to features & some object instances
    2) Requires security grid during rqts process
    3) UI work
    4) Assign "role" & "permissions"
    
    Notes:
    - Admin can have only 1 Role
    - Permissions are tied to Roles
    - RolePermissions serve as a template for Permissions tied to Admin when Role is selected for that Admin
    - AdminPermissions (i.e. Authorizations) can be modified independent of RolePermissions
    - Permissions are broken down by Module
    - Modules are tied to Accounts
    - Modules must be made available to Accounts in order to give Admins tied to that Account access to those Modules
    - Admins must be given access to a Module before they can be given access to Permissions within that Module

  description: "Can send a bulletin notifying subscribers of a page update, and the bulletin contains a description of the change\r\n\
    Screen shot or other reproduction of the change on the site, not just raw HTML code.\r\n\
    user: admin\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Today, the legend system only includes a change report in the email sent to the admin who owns the topic (e.g. primary item admin). The change report is difficult to read b/c it shows the HTML markup for both the original and the changed version. We can't send this change report to the subscribers b/c they wouldn't know how to interpret it. Even the admins have trouble with the change report. In order to communicate the change to the subscribers, the admin has a few choices: \r\n\
    a. Send the default page change content. THis is one line that indicates the page has changed, and includes a link back to the page.\r\n\
    b. THe admin returns to the changed page and either takes a snapshot or otherwise copies the change and pastes it into the item that is sent to the subscriber. \r\n\
    c. The agency changes what is watched from an HTML page to an RSS feed. Legend renders RSS feeds directly into the email that is sent out. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    There are two theories on the changes. \r\n\
    1. THe single line of text indicating there is a change is sufficient b/c the admins want the traffic back to their site.2. As a service to the subscribers, we should always include lots of information. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I suggest changing this user story to make it address including the HTML page content only, and turning that feature on/off. A separate story should cover duplicating the legend one line of text story. "

    ========
    1. Internal Admin creates a new account and assigns Feature 1, 2 and 3 to the account
    2. Internal Admin creates AccoutAdmin A for the account and assigns access to Features 1 and 2 to the Account Admin 
    3. Internal Admin creates AccoutAdmin B for the account and assigns access to Features 2 and 3 to the Account Admin 
    
    Requirements
    -----------
    1. Admins with AssignPermissions
    permissions can assign feature access, role assignment, and permissions to an Admin. 
    
    Examples
    --------
    1. HTML newsletter Feature is active for an account
    A. AccountAdmin A can access the feature, create a newsletter, and create templates 
    B. AccountAdmin B can't access the feature
    C. AccountAdmin C can access the feature, create a newsletter, but cannot create templates
