    Need to be able to determine the monthly sending budget for the client so that GovDelivery can control message sending costs through a third party
    For example, CDC agrees to 20K sending units per month at a cost of $.10 per unit (i.e. .10 * 20K = $2K/Mo.), while St Louis Park, MN agrees to 500 sending units per month at a cost of $.15 per unit (i.e. .15 * 20K = $75/Mo.)

  lock_version: "6"

  mnemonic: ACOU-50
  description: |
    An internal admin can associate one other internal admin with an account. The user profile associated with the account is typically a GovDelivery Client Services employee, such as an Account Manager. 
    
    This is the person who has management responsibility for the account. 
    
    In the future we will want this user to receive messages related to the account. Also, we'll want to be able to filter accounts by which internal admin is responsible for the account. 
    
    Rules
    The Internal Admin exists in the system
    Select the admin from a drop list
    If the admin is deleted, set the value to 'unassigned'
    One admin owner per account
    
    Use Case:
    internal sales rep opens a new account and assigns a training session with a account manager (eg. Sam) 
    Sam will now receive messages regarding the account 
    Sam can log into EVO and filter on which accounts belongs to him and others

    Want the system to Send welcome new user email for all new administrators
    user: admin
    
    The email contains an encrypted link to the system's password create page.
    
    (See Story [USER-107](http://buildbox/travis/stories/107))
    
    Link expires in 24 hours. For a new user profile, when the link is expired the admin user must be created from scratch. For the reset password scenario, the admin user must start the process over (e.g. access the login page, click reset PW, etc.)
    
    Use Case:
    user gets set up with account.
    the account has information regarding there email, personal info etc
    to personalize there password for the account the user gets the welcome email in the inbox to set up password and make any updates to the their account profile.

    From Brett:
    1) Roles & Rights limit access to features & some object instances
    2) Requires security grid during rqts process
    3) UI work
    4) Assign "role" & "permissions"
    
    Notes:
    - Admin can have only 1 Role
    - Permissions are tied to Roles
    - RolePermissions serve as a template for Permissions tied to Admin when Role is selected for that Admin
    - AdminPermissions (i.e. Authorizations) can be modified independent of RolePermissions
    - Permissions are broken down by Module
    - Modules are tied to Accounts
    - Modules must be made available to Accounts in order to give Admins tied to that Account access to those Modules
    - Admins must be given access to a Module before they can be given access to Permissions within that Module

    When document is Page Watch, Multiple URLs, show edition options
    
    DNS: This whole multi-URL concept needs a thorough review.  I would guess that 98%+ of PW items are single-URL.  Multi-URL had it's genesis in content management, and I wonder how necessary it is in a non-CM GovDelivery.  Julie and Sara will be valuable in describing the need here.

    DNS: Should this be classified under \"subscriptions\"?  There are trade-offs to the proposed approach at right.\n\
    I wish we did a better job (based upon Julie\x92s list of common mistakes) of noticing when an e-mail address couldn\x92t possibly be valid.  I wish we performed this check everywhere e-mail addresses can get added to the system.\n\
    When a subscriber submits the \x93New Subscriber\x94 form (presently login_new.html), I wish we attempted to send the \x93Welcome New Subscriber\x94 e-mail for some easily-modifiable timeout period.  Only if we get a 500-series error back from the remote MTA, we should kick the subscriber back to the \x93New Subscriber\x94 page with an error.  If anything other than a 500-series error happens (including if the connection times out), then we should assume this address is innocent until proven guilty.\n\

    **NOTES ON USAGE**  
    this story is satisfied by adding the ability to load seed data into a brand-new database.
    
    This can be done by executing the following:
    
    `RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed`
    
    **This will destroy the database for the environment that it's pointed at!!!**  If we get a requirement that we need to be able to replace/append/save existing data while still being able to run this, it will need to be reworked.

    Subscribers should have the ability to delete their profile and all of their subscriptions as one task. For example, I have 5 profiles for 5 accounts, all with the same email address should be deleted from all accounts at once. We need to verify this reqt with the Account Managers before we implement it.

    * After the account is selected, all other activities apply to that account only, not the entire system. 
    * Show on the UI which account is currently selected. 
    * Give me the ability to select a different account once one is selected, without logging in again. 
    * ALso, allow me to get out of an account conmpletely (no account selected). e.g. I can now create another internal admin. 
    * When an account is selected, and I'm creating a new user, limit the list of roles to roles availalbe for external users only. (e.g. I can't select AccountManager)
    * To create an internal user, I can't have an account selected

    The Admin list page allows filtering by role, account, AND email address. 
    
    AND is important because we can filter first by role, then by email address to find a user or group users.
    
    Filters can be at the account level (e.g. I already selected FBI, so now I can filter the FBI user profiles) or global (e.g. I'm an internal user and I can see ALL user profiles)
    
    The user lists should separate subscribers and admins.
    
    user: admin
    
    please allow for spaces after or before what keyword or subject the user will be filtering on
    charc or symbols are also allowed

    When an internal admin logs into Evo, they can access to a list of accounts (see Evo ticket ACOUT-49, Itr 1), from this page they can navigate from account to account so they make changes at each of those accounts. 
    
    This story is tied directly to [ACOU-93](http://buildbox/travis/stories/93) although it isn't the same story.

    When I'm logged into Evo, I want to see my user profile in a list, select it and edit my personal information, such as the spelling of my name.
    
    
    Requirements
    1. Admin cannot change their own email address, which is their login ID. Show the login ID on the UI, but don't allow it to be edited.
    
    2. Admin cannot change their own role or permissions. 
    
    Editing other admin's info is ([USER-389] http://buildbox/travis/stories/389)
    
    Use Case
    
    - AccountAdmin logs into EVO
    - Evo displays list of users (Account Home Page), with the logged in user at the top of the list. All other users are in alpha order below. 
    3. Admin clicks his own user profile from the list
    4. AccountAdmin edits last name
    5. AccountAdmin clicks Save
    6. Evo displays Account Home page, with updated info
    
    Extension
    TopicAdmin changes personal information
    1a. TopicAdmin logs into EVO
    2a. Evo displays only the logged in user (along with the edit tabs on the side)
    3a. Topicamdin is able to update info (same as above)
    4a. clicks save in EVO and Account Home page is updated with the info
