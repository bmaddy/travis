    		~/scratch/tag_service$ jruby script/runner -e development lib/auto_tag.rb
    		JRuby limited openssl loaded. gem install jruby-openssl for full support.
    		http://wiki.jruby.org/wiki/JRuby_Builtin_OpenSSL
    		Enter a partner id: 5109
    		Found 8 to autotag, continue? y
    		autotagging...
