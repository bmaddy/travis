send a bulletin notifying subscribers of a page update, and the bulletin contains a description of the change\\r\\n\\\n  Screen shot or other reproduction of the change on the site, not just raw HTML code.\\r\\n\\\n  user: admin\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Today, the legend system only includes a change report in the email sent to the admin who owns the topic (e.g. primary item admin). The change report is difficult to read b/c it shows the HTML markup for both the original and the changed version. We can\'t send this change report to the subscribers b/c they wouldn\'t know how to interpret it. Even the admins have trouble with the change report. In order to communicate the change to the subscribers, the admin has a few choices: \\r\\n\\\n  a. Send the default page change content. THis is one line that indicates the page has changed, and includes a link back to the page.\\r\\n\\\n  b. THe admin returns to the changed page and either takes a snapshot or otherwise copies the change and pastes it into the item that is sent to the subscriber. \\r\\n\\\n  c. The agency changes what is watched from an HTML page to an RSS feed. Legend renders RSS feeds directly into the email that is sent out. \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  There are two theories on the changes. \\r\\n\\\n  1. THe single line of text indicating there is a change is sufficient b/c the admins want the traffic back to their site.2. As a service to the subscribers, we should always include lots of information. \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I suggest changing this user story to make it address including the HTML page content only, and turning that feature on/off. A separate story should cover duplicating the legend one line of text story. \"\n','2008-07-10 13:55:27','2008-07-10 13:55:27',NULL),(309,'brett',326,'--- \nupdated_at: \n- 2008-07-10 12:43:44 -05:00\n- 2008-07-10 14:04:36.718186 -05:00\ndescription: \n- |-\n  Wish there were a new, publicly-available Bulletin Page.

The change report is difficult to read b/c it shows the HTML markup for both the original and the changed version. We can\'t send this change report to the subscribers b/c they wouldn\'t know how to interpret it. Even the admins have trouble with the change report. In order to communicate the change to the subscribers, the admin has a few choices: \r\na. Send the default page change content. THis is one line that indicates the page has changed, and includes a link back to the page.\r\nb. THe admin returns to the changed page and either takes a snapshot or otherwise copies the change and pastes it into the item that is sent to the subscriber. \r\nc. The agency changes what is watched from an HTML page to an RSS feed. Legend renders RSS feeds directly into the email that is sent out. \r\n\r\nThere are two theories on the changes. \r\n1. THe single line of text indicating there is a change is sufficient b/c the admins want the traffic back to their site.2. As a service to the subscribers, we should always include lots of information. \r\n\r\nI suggest changing this user story to make it address including the HTML page content only, and turning that feature on/off. A separate story should cover duplicating the legend one line of text story.
